# MQTT-Doorbell

I wanted my doorbell to be able to be muted for when I work nightshifts and am asleep during the day.
While I was at it, I wanted to be able to get it to generate an MQTT message when the doorbell was pressed. 

(I have connected this into Node-Red to be able to generate emails to tell me when someone rang the bell)
